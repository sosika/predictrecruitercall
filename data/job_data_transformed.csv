So why work at Kyndryl? We are always moving forward - always pushing ourselves to go further in our efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive world for our employees, our customers and our communities.<br><br><b>The Role</b><br><br>Kyndryl Project Managers oversee the delivery of major projects within scope, schedule, and budget. You'll be the driving force for every aspect of a program's success, and the ""conductor"" who orchestrates everyone's efforts to make beautiful music together. As the single point of contact to the client, you'll also be the living embodiment of Kyndryl's reputation every day.<br><br>As Project Manager, you have command of a very full and detail-oriented calendar. You'll be constructing detailed project plans, managing teams, and leading meetings, status calls, and planning and cadence meetings. You will analyze and mitigate risks, manage finances, make sure the team has the right skills, then plan and delegate activity to hit deadlines, deliver on SLAs, and generally delight our clients. Of course, plans often evolve as a project unfolds, so you'll need to practice continuous structural thinking and take ownership for value delivery, not just task scheduling.<br><br>But as important as planning and organization are, communication is 90% of the job. You're the single point of contact with the client, partners, and all stakeholders, supporting them and ensuring they get what they need. You're also the bridge to every other team on the project, including both technical and account roles. The result is an exciting multicultural, often multilingual environment. Bottom line: You need to like interactions with other people and know how to be kind and empathetic but also assertive - and handle customer change requests with diplomacy.<br><br>You're going to be meeting a lot of people, networking, and forging relationships. Our ""one team with the customer"" concept means you'll develop especially strong partnerships with the client and elsewhere. Some projects or clients even involve ""embedding"" with the client at their location. This puts more visibility on you personally, but it also gives you more opportunity to add value to the relationship. This is one of the things Kyndryls love about working here. It's a great way to hone your service and people skills, and it lays the groundwork for career growth both laterally and vertically.<br><br>Your future at Kyndryl<br>Becoming a Project Manager at Kyndryl is an excellent gateway to many different paths. You'll be creating a well-rounded skillset while gaining professional certifications and qualifications.

There are many different types and flavors of PM roles, so everyone can find the opportunity that suits them best.<br><br><b>Who You Are</b><br><br>You're good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important - you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer-focused - someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you're open and borderless - naturally inclusive in how you work with others.<br><br><b>Required Technical and Professional Experience</b><br>At least 3 years of experience with:<br>• SCRUM or Project Management skills<br>• Basic TI knowledge (architectural)<br>• Organization and planning skills<br>• Teamwork with ""one team"" philosophy<br>• English<br><br><b>Preferred Technical and Professional Experience</b><br>• MS Project or other Project Management software<br>• Excellent written and verbal communication skills<br>• Ability to interact confidently with stakeholders of all levels<br><br><b>Being You</b><br><br>Diversity is a whole lot more than what we look like or where we come from, it's how we think and who we are. We welcome people of all cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. But we're not doing it single-handily: Our Kyndryl Inclusion Networks are only one of many ways we create a workplace where all Kyndryls can find and provide support and advice.
